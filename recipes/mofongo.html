    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
      Mofongo is a traditional <em>Puerto Rican</em> dish made primarily from fried green plantains that are mashed together with
      garlic, olive oil, and chicharrón (fried pork skin). The result is a savory, hearty mound of plantains that can be
      served on its own or paired with proteins like shrimp, chicken, or beef, often accompanied by a rich broth or sauce. Its
      origins are rooted in African culinary traditions brought to the Caribbean, and over time it has become a defining
      comfort food of Puerto Rican cuisine, celebrated for its bold flavor and satisfying texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, mofongo highlights the versatility of the plantain, transforming it into a dish that balances starchy,
      garlicky, and meaty flavors. While the traditional preparation uses a wooden mortar and pestle (pilón), variations
      abound—some add cheese, seafood, or vegetables, while others replace pork cracklings with bacon or keep it vegetarian.
      Regardless of the spin, mofongo remains a beloved symbol of Puerto Rican culinary identity, often enjoyed both in casual
      family meals and festive gatherings.
